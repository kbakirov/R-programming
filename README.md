# Statistics and Machine Learning algorithms
Building statistical models and applying ML algorithms on data to extract insights  

## Projects
- [Implementing Decision Tree algorithm](https://github.com/kbakirov/R-programming/tree/master/Decision_Tree)
- [Linear Regression on House price prediction](https://github.com/kbakirov/Statistics-and-Machine-Learning-algorithms/tree/master/Linear%20Regression)
- [Classification of MNIST handwritten digits](https://github.com/kbakirov/Statistics-and-Machine-Learning-algorithms/tree/master/Classification)

## This checklist can guide you through your Machine Learning projects. There are eight main steps:
- Frame the problem and look at the big picture.
- Get the data.
- Explore the data to gain insights.
- Prepare the data to better expose the underlying data patterns to Machine Learning algorithms.
- Explore many different models and shortlist the best ones.
- Fine-tune your models and combine them into a great solution.
- Present your solution.
- Launch, monitor, and maintain your system.
Obviously, you should feel free to adapt this checklist to your needs.
